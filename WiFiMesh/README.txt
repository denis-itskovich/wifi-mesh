WiFi Mesh Compilation instructions
1. Install Visual Studio 2008
2. Install Qt for VS2008 to some directory (e.g. C:\Qt\4.6.2)
3. Define environment variable named 'QtDir' with value of the directory above (e.g. C:\Qt\4.6.2).
   Please note, step 3 should be performed BEFORE RUNNING VISUAL STUDIO, since a process reads environment
   variables upon creation.

5. Build solution
