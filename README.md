## Wi-Fi Mesh Simulator Pro
#### Introduction
This simulator was developed as an academic project in 2009. It is not officially supported anymore, but you are welcome to fork and change it if you wish.

#### Features
Allows to simulate traffic and routing building between moving in 2D space stations. Each station has the following properties:
* Initial location
* Data traffic schedule
* Velocity vector
* During simulation, each station faces with constantly changing network topology, updating dynamic routing tables automatically, finding a route to destination.

Simulator allows to analyze:
* Total traffic ratio
* Effective traffic ratio
* Collisions ratio
* Maximum/Minimum/Average throughput

Simulator has very extensive GUI, allowing performing deeper research, such as:
* Sniffing - all frame transactions (filtering by frame type may be applied)
* Current station position and it's velocity vector
* All data transaction shown on the world map
* Each station may be investigated for packets queue and routing table
